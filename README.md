# React Native FlatList: Inconsistent Rendering with Complex Data

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Native's FlatList component with complex data structures.  The problem revolves around inconsistent rendering, potentially due to improper key management or inefficient rendering strategies.

## Problem Description

The `FlatList` component, while highly performant, can exhibit unexpected rendering behavior when supplied with deeply nested data or when `keyExtractor` isn't correctly implemented. This often results in inconsistent item display, poor scrolling performance, or memory leaks.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on implementing a robust `keyExtractor` function and ensuring that rendering logic is optimized for performance.  This usually involves carefully selecting the keys based on unique identifiers within the data and leveraging `ItemSeparatorComponent` for visual separation and improved performance.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering behavior in the initial example and the improved rendering in the solution.
